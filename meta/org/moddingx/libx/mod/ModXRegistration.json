Create some static methods  there that register all the items. To register something you need to call<br> <ref cls=\"org/moddingx/libx/mod/ModXRegistration\" method=\"register\" type=\"<T>(net.minecraft.resources.ResourceKey<? extends net.minecraft.core.Registry<T>>,java.lang.String,T)void\">#register(ResourceKey, String, Object)</ref>.  Then in the constructor of your mod class, you call <ref cls=\"org/moddingx/libx/mod/ModXRegistration\" method=\"addRegistrationHandler\" type=\"(java.lang.Runnable)void\">#addRegistrationHandler(Runnable)</ref> for every  registration method with a method reference to it. (Example: <code>addRegistrationHandler(ModItems::init)</code>.  The handlers will get called in the order you added them.<br>  This system has several advantages over the one recommended by forge:<br>  <ul>      <li>An object can have dependencies that are automatically registered with it. This is done with      the <ref cls=\"org/moddingx/libx/registration/Registerable\">Registerable</ref> interface. For example <ref cls=\"org/moddingx/libx/base/tile/BlockBE\">BlockBE</ref> registers a <ref cls=\"net/minecraft/world/level/block/Block\">block</ref>,      an <ref cls=\"net/minecraft/world/item/Item\">item</ref> for the block and a <ref cls=\"net/minecraft/world/level/block/entity/BlockEntityType\">block entity type</ref>. You could even      go further with it and automatically register slabs, stairs, walls and doors for all of your<br>     decorative blocks.</li>      <li>You don't need the <code>.get()</code> when you want to access a registration object</li>  </ul>  <br> The system allows to create <ref cls=\"net/minecraft/core/Holder\">holders</ref>. However, this will only work for vanilla registries  that support holder creation prior to registering the item."}}
